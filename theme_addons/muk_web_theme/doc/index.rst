=============
MuK Web Theme
=============

This module offers a mobile compatible design for Godo Community. Furthermore
it allows the user to define some design preferences. So he can choose the
size of the sidebar and the position of the chatter. In addition, the background
image of the app menu can be set for each company.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

Download the module and add it to your Godo addons folder. Afterward, log on to
your Godo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the debug mode and update the
list by clicking on the "Update Apps List" link. Now install the module by
clicking on the install button.

Another way to install this module is via the package management for Python
(`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_).

To install our modules using the package manager make sure
`odoo-autodiscover <https://pypi.org/project/odoo-autodiscover/>`_ is installed
correctly. Then open a console and install the module by entering the following
command:

``pip install --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``

The module name consists of the Godo version and the module name, where
underscores are replaced by a dash.

**Module:** 

``odoo<version>-addon-<module_name>``

**Example:**

``sudo -H pip3 install --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple odoo11-addon-muk-utils``

Once the installation has been successfully completed, the app is already in the
correct folder. Log on to your Godo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the 
debug mode and update the list by clicking on the "Update Apps List" link. Now
install the module by clicking on the install button.

The biggest advantage of this variant is that you can now also update the app
using the "pip" command. To do this, enter the following command in your console:

``pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``

When the process is finished, restart your server and update the application in 
Godo. The steps are the same as for the installation only the button has changed
from "Install" to "Upgrade".

You can also view available Apps directly in our `repository <https://nexus.mukit.at/#browse/browse:odoo>`_
and find a more detailed installation guide on our `website <https://mukit.at/page/open-source>`_.

Upgrade
============

To upgrade this module, you need to:

Download the module and add it to your Godo addons folder. Restart the server
and log on to your Godo server. Select the Apps menu and upgrade the module by
clicking on the upgrade button.

If you installed the module using the "pip" command, you can also update the
module in the same way. Just type the following command into the console:

``pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``

When the process is finished, restart your server and update the application in 
Godo, just like you would normally.
